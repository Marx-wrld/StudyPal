# StudyPal

StudyPal is a Python-Django application that attempts to imitate Discord. It utilizes Django's CRUD operations functionality. Users can create, update and delete rooms. Editing and deleting can also only be done by the user that created the room or wrote the comment or topic. Users also have their authenticated profiles that they can update at will.
I've also included a REST API, built from this app's data.

- Don't execute the custom-user-model folder as part of the app
