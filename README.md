# studypal

Studypal is a Python-Django application that attempts to imitate Discord. It utilizes the CRUD operations functionality that Django offers. Users can create, update and delete rooms. Editing and deleting can also only be done by the user that created the room or wrote the comment or topic. Users also have their authenticated profiles that they can update at will.
It also uses a REST API with help from the Django REST framework.
